Setup Instructions

cd HR\ projectSS


Important: Folder Naming Requirement The project’s CSS files are linked relative to a root directory named:

HR projectSS

1. Ensure this exact folder name is maintained when cloning or renaming the project. Incorrect folder naming may result in broken stylesheet links.

2. Run Locally Using VS Code: This project is optimized for local development using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension.

○ Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code

○ Right-click on splash.html and select "Open with Live Server"

○ The project will automatically launch in your default web browser

○ Live Server also provides hot reloading for easier development and testing

3. If you do not have Live Server installed, you can add it via the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.
